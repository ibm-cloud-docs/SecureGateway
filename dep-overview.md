- At the end of marketing, users that don't have {{site.data.keyword.SecureGateway}} instances will be blocked from deploying new instances. All users that have {{site.data.keyword.SecureGateway}} instances instances deployed can still keep deploying and re-deploying normally and as needed.
- No other service or service will be affected other than {{site.data.keyword.SecureGateway}}
- Be sure that you migrate to another method of secure data communication in before the End-of-Support date.
- Only paid versions of {{site.data.keyword.SecureGateway}} will remain fully functional until the End-of-Support date - that includes “Professional” and “Enterprise”. The “Essentials” free version ends on the above timeline. Changing from “Essentials” to one of the other two versions will be required.
-Reminders of the approaching "End-of-Support" date will continue to be sent periodically by email to all users that have {{site.data.keyword.SecureGateway}} instances running. Those reminder emails will end when all your {{site.data.keyword.SecureGateway}} instances are deleted.
